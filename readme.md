# Hecto
This is a basic text editor written in Rust, based on the idea proposed [here](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial). 
However, this project does not follow the tutorial, and instead does its own thing, based on the [original tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).
