# Hecto
This is a basic text editor written in Rust, based on the idea proposed [here](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial). 
However, this project does not follow the tutorial, and instead does its own thing, based on the [original tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). 

This was my first project in Rust, used to learn the language. This implementation has a few additional features, like auto-indentation and C syntax highlighting, but is still quite barebones. I wouldn't use it :)
